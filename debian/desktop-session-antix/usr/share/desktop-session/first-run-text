Yeah this is the first run!

With live the xdg autostart compliance is turned off. This is to 
avoid several nagging windows at startup. If you are running an 
install or live usb, you may wish to enable the xdg autostart 
compliance. To do this 
Access the desktop menu
Select "Desktop"
Select "Session Settings (Global)"
Enter "YOUR ROOT PASSWORD" and press "OK"
Find:
LOAD_XDG_AUTOSTART="false"
and change to 
LOAD_XDG_AUTOSTART="true"
Save the change

Now next time you restart your session xdg autostart compliance 
will be enabled.

There are several other interesting features and programs such
 as the metapackage installer, antiX Control Center, and 
 connect shares. If you would like to know more of the features
 and programs, visit the help section of the desktop menu.
